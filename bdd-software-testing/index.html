                            class="text-green">Acceptance Test Driven Development</span> truly turn the testing world on
                        its head. How so? Instead of testing after development, <em><strong>you test before</em></strong>.
                        This seems simple but the ramifications are considerable.</p>

                    <p>Many testing techniques and ideas have been called revolutions but regrettably, the truth is that
                        the majority are nothing more than a band-aid style solution and solve next to nothing with the
                        testing process.</p><a href="#strap" data-scroll="#strap" class="cta btn btn-primary btn-large">Why

            <p>There are 2 types of defect that can affect your product</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="span2 text-right"><span class="huge">"</span></div>
                <div class="span10 text-left"><h4>Implementation Defect</h4>

                    <p>The product doesn&#39;t work as intended by the developers, either by crashing or by producing the
                        wrong results. These defects are normally due to bugs; perhaps the developers made a mistake or
                        made an incorrect assumption as to how something works.</p></div>
            </div>

                <div class="span10 text-left"><h4>Requirements Defect</h4>

                    <p>The product works exactly as intended by the developers, but the users or customers are not
                        satisfied with it. These are issues which have nothing to do with bad or sloppy code, rather
                        with lack of clarity and miscommunication in the requirements capture process. Unstated user
                        expectations and tacit, misunderstood or simply incorrect requirements are typical causes of
                        Requirements Defects.</p></div>

        <div class="box"><h3>The Avoidable Cost</h3>

            <p>Anything up to 50-60% of issues identified by software testers can be chalked down as Requirements
                Defects. Unfortunately, because the code has been written, defects such as these cost between 100% to
                200% more to fix than other defects.</p>

            <p>Why are testers looking for defects after the implementation work has been carried out? If 50-60% of all
                the issues identified by software testers are Requirements Defects, why have they been left in for
                developers to work on? This is a massive wasted effort, not to mention waste of time and budget.</p>

        <div class="box"><h2>The Revolution Is</h2>

            <h1>Behaviour Driven Development</h1>

            <p>Now you might say "But this doesn&#39;t apply to me and my team because we work Agile, so how would BBD help
                in my case?" While Agile truly does help to minimize instances of massive do-overs, in truth, all to
                often what Agile does is mitigate by finding errors and bugs after two weeks instead of after two
                months. However, BDD irons all of these issues out before they are ever coded, during the requirements
                phase so that the vast majority of defects quite simply never come into being.</p>

            <h3>So, how does BBD work then?</h3>

            <p>Behaviour Driven Development (and in turn our very own product <a href="#behave" data-scroll="#behave">Behave
                for JIRA</a>) work like so. The business analyst or specialist liaises with requirements manager and
                tester and together they test out requirements between them, using scenarios. This collaboration
                uncovers where issues and defects are likely to happen much faster and more efficiently than any other
                approach. If you use user stories as the basis of requirements, the user stories get fleshed out and
                detailed in this way. In the briefest and simplest of terms, BDD works simply by describing what you
                want.</p>

            <p>After all, and everyone knows this, the better the requirements are the better the quality of the work
                and the better the quality of the software.</p>

            <h3>What does BDD change?</h3>

            <p>BDD does change a few things, but worry not, we&#39;re not reinventing the wheel here, merely optimising
                it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>BDD brings a change in the tester&#39;s role since some of their time moves to the front of the chain
                    when they test the requirements, instead of the same time being expended at the end of the chain
                    when testing the code.
                </li>
                <li>And of course BDD changes software development by making it much more focused on and grounded in
                    quality, tested and proven requirements.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>But isn&#39;t BDD and the like all about Test Automation?</h3>

            <p>Wrong. It&#39;s true that BDD and ATDD tools such as Cucumber and SpecFlow are often used in Test Automation
                however, that is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Saying that these tools are simply Test
                Automation tools is a rather narrow viewpoint which completely misses the benefits brought about by the
                hugely improved requirements and time saved as well as the cost savings brought about by these changes
                in workflow and methodology.</p></div>

                    <p>You will start to discover <strong>better, more thorough requirements</strong> by collaborating
                        with all stakeholders involved.</p>

                    <p>Your acceptance criteria are specified as simple, understandable and <strong>human friendly
                        scenarios</strong>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pull acceptance tests from JIRA</strong> into your build environment seamlessly and with
                        no issues.</p>

                    <p><strong>Less defects in production, higher defect detection</strong> later on in bug testing, all
                        as a result of better communication during requirements gathering.</p>

                    <p><strong>Test with Cucumber</strong> to ensure your code does what it should.</p>

                    <p>Provided that your scenarios describe functionality, you will get <strong>helpful
                        documentation</strong> almost as a &#39;happy coincidence&#39;</p>
