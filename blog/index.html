			</div>
			<div class="post-content">
				
					
					<p>Automated functional tests provide valuable feedback to developers by notifying them when they have completed or broken functionality. The value of these tests can be
maximised by providing the test results in the shortest possible time. The reason being the problem is likely to be fresh in the developer's mind and quicker for them to fix.</p>

<p>A typical functional or UI test suite can take many hours to run because the tests can only be run sequentially. The main cause for the sequential tests is the dependence
on data. Common practice has test cases clear the database of the application under test and populate it with the required data before it starts. This high level of database
manipulation does not allow the tests to be run in parallel because each test will interfere with the database at different times, therefore corrupting data required used by other tests.</p>

<p><img src="/gallery/batched_test_jobs.png" style="float: right; padding: 1em;"/></p>

<p>The common solution for long running test suites is to break them into batches and run each batch on a separate machine with its own instance of the application under test
and its database. This is easy to achieve using spare hardware, Virtual Machine's or Cloud computing resources. You don't even have to write code for spinning up new
machines, or access remote machines, as Continuous Integration (CI) servers like Jenkins and Bamboo provide functionality for running builds on multiple computers. This feature is better known as Slaves or Agents.</p>

<p>The majority of the popular testing tools have ways of grouping tests together and we can use this feature to create our "Batches" of tests. These features are known as
"categories" in JUnit, "groups" in TestNG and "tags" in Cucumber, Lettuce and Behat.</p>

<h2>Creating batches of Tests with JUnit</h2>

<p>JUnit 4.8 introduces a '@Category' annotation for specifying the group that the test class (which will include all the methods within the class) or method belongs to.
The category names for tests are not defined as Strings but as Java Classes, so for each batch or test category we will need to create a Java interface to represent it.
We could create a plain Java Class instead of an interface but as the class will never instantiated and no methods need to be implemented, it's safer to use interfaces.
Tests can be assigned to a category by simply adding the "Category" annotation to the test class or method with the appropriate interface representing the batch as a parameter.</p>

<pre><code>import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.experimental.categories.Category;
import com.hindsighttesting.junit.batches.BatchA;

@Category(BatchA.class)
public class MyTest {
    @Test
    @Category(Slow.class)
    public void aTest() {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Running a Batch of Tests</h2>

<p>To adapt an existing Maven build for running your tests using the JUnit categories is rather simple. The first step is to configure the <code>maven-surefire-plugin</code> to use the correct
JUnit provider. Support for Categories is available in the JUnit 4.7 Surefire Provider and this can be configured just by adding the <code>org.apache.maven.surefire:surefire-junit47</code>
 dependency to the <code>maven-surefire-plugin</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;build&gt;
    &lt;plugins&gt;
        ...
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-surefire-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;2.11&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;dependencies&gt;
                &lt;dependency&gt;
                    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.surefire&lt;/groupId&gt;
                    &lt;artifactId&gt;surefire-junit47&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                    &lt;version&gt;2.12&lt;/version&gt;
                &lt;/dependency&gt;
            &lt;/dependencies&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There are two ways of specifying the categories to use for selecting tests to execute. The first is to specify the category in the <code>groups</code> property of the Plugin configuration within your POM file.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;groups&gt;com.hindsighttesting.junit.batches.BatchA&lt;/groups&gt;
 &lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The disadvantage of this method is the lack of flexibility in specifying which test batch/category should be executed. You could use Maven profiles to provide the flexibility but this would
increase the size and complexity of the POM file. Handy for us, the <code>groups</code> property can be specified from the command line as a property.</p>

<pre><code>$ mvn test -Dgroups=com.hindsighttesting.junit.batches.BatchA
</code></pre>

<h3>Configuring the Continuous Integration (CI) jobs</h3>

<p>Now that we know how to select tests as groups to run as batches we need to configure our CI server to schedule and run all our Test batches at the same time. For each batch we need to create
a new build job and configure it to run the appropriate JUnit test batch.</p>

<p>We need to trigger and execute all our Test batch jobs once the upstream job ("compile" in the diagram) has successfully completed and only execute the downstream job once all the Test batch jobs have completed.</p>

<p><img src="/gallery/ci-job-structure.png" style="padding: 1em;"/></p>

<p>In Jenkins/Hudson we can easily trigger all the test batch jobs by using <code>Post-build Actions</code> and selecting <code>Build other projects</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/gallery/jenkins-post-build-actions.png" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; padding: 1em;"/></p>

<p>Waiting for all Batched test jobs to finish before starting the next job is not so simple. For this we require the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Join+Plugin">Join Plugin</a>
and this adds a new "Post-build Action" called "Join Trigger". The "Join Trigger" is added as a "Post Build action" to the upstream job that triggers our batched test jobs. The upstream job will then trigger the
downstream job to start once all the batched tests are finished.</p>

<p><img src="/gallery/jenkins-join-trigger.png" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; padding: 1em;"/></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have described a simple way of speeding up large sequential test suites by breaking tests down into batches and running each batch concurrently on separate machines using the slave/agent
functionality of CI servers. It's worth remembering this isn't true concurrent test execution and there are drawbacks to this technique when compared to true concurrency:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scaling is limited by machine availability</li>
<li>Available processing power is used inefficiently e.g. by not using all available CPU cores</li>
<li>Additional time is required to manage batches of tests - tests have to be moved between batches to even out total test execution time.</li>
</ul>


<p>At <a href="http://oredev.org/2012/sessions/cutting-testing-time-with-parallel-automated-functional-tests">OREDEV 2012</a> I will be discussing the disadvantages of this pseudo concurrent
technique and how true concurrent test execution can be achieved. For those of you who are not attending OREDEV this year or who miss my presentation (there are so many great presentations scheduled), I will be
following up with additional posts over the next 8 weeks to expand on this topic.</p>

					<p><img style="float:left; padding-right: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em;" src="/gallery/jDays_logo_RGB_speaker_emblem_pa1.png"/> Got the burning desire to learn Cucumber-JVM but don't know where to start? We are pleased to announce that we will be running a one day tutorial on “BDD with Cucumber-JVM” at jDays  Gothenburg on the 5th of December. The tutorial is free for all the attendees of jDays, a three day conference for Java professionals held at the Swedish Exhibition &amp; Congress Centre, Gothenburg
Sweden. Full details are available at the <a href="http://www.jdays.se/course-information/">jDays website</a></p>

<p>The one day tutorial will give a strong foundation in Cucumber JVM, a rewrite of Cuke4Duke, the tool many Java developers use for writing and running BDD style acceptance tests. The main focus of this course will be on how to write automated acceptance tests for BDD scenarios, though there will be an introduction to BDD given for people not familiar with it.</p>

<h3>Topics covered:</h3>

<ul>
<li>BDD basics</li>
<li>Automating scenarios by writing Java glue code for Cucumber-JVM</li>
<li>How to run automated Scenarios using JUnit or Maven</li>

				<h2><a href="/blog/2012/06/01/raspberry-pi-jira-information-raditor/">A Slice of Pi with your Information Radiator</a></h2>
			</div>
			<div class="post-content">
				
					
					<p>Most of you would of heard of the Raspberry Pi - a low powered credit card sized computer released in the last few months. After a wait I managed to get my hands on one of these nifty devices and have put one of my ideas into action: a power efficient information radiator.</p>

<p>Information radiators are very useful visual tools that allow anyone at a glance to see the state of the project and receive feedback from important systems. Typically an old or spare PC is used to run a web browser rendering information to a large screen or TV displayed in the team's work area. JIRA has a handy Wallboard plugin that can turn any dashboard into a format to appear on a Information Radiator.</p>

<p>With PCs using between 60-300 watts of power they are not the most power efficient compared to the Raspberry's 2 watts. The Raspberry Pi also has other benefits.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cost: Old machines while still capable often need new components due to age and many years of use. The cost of a Raspberry Pi is approx $25-35 per unit depending on the model. This price is often the same or cheaper than replacing a Power supply or Hard disk of a old computer.</li>
<li>GPIO: The Raspberry has a set of pins which can be used to interface it to electronics. This could be used to drive lamps or LEDs to draw team members attention to the information radiator when important events occur, e.g. Build Fail</li>
<li>Small and Quiet: The circuit board of the Raspberry could be mounted on the back of the Visual Display whereas a PC is rather large and heavy.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Enough of the why, does the Raspberry Pi work?</h2>

<p>Spoiler alert! It does work but not out of the box.</p>

<p>My first attempt at the information radiator was using the stock Debian Squeeze distribution provided by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. This distribution comes with the lightweight Webkit (the same engine as Chrome and Safari) based browser, Midori. The version of Midori happens to be 0.2.4-3 and couldn't handle the Javascript with JIRA 5  (I haven't tested other JIRA versions).</p>

<p><img src="/gallery/RaspberryPiAssembled.jpg"/></p>

<h2>Hang on, Firefox and Chrome are both available on Linux.</h2>

<p>The Raspberry Pi has a ARM 11 based processor so we are limited on choice of Linux distributions and the packages which have been compiled for "armtel".</p>

<p>There is a community project <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/">raspbian</a> currently porting the more up to date Debian Whezzy distribution to the ARM processor used in the Raspberry. This saved the day because it provided a cross compiled version of Midori 0.4.3 with good javascript support.</p>

<p>Raspbian is in the early stages of development and no official images have been provided, but there are Community produce images available. I used the image produced by <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/HexxehImages">Hexxeh</a>, version r3. Once I had written this image to my SD card, I booted the Raspberry Pi and logged in using the "root" user and "hexxeh" password.</p>

<p>The image is rather simple and we need to add a few extra packages and configurations to make it useful for our purposes.</p>

<p><code>$ apt-get install ntp fake-hwclock</code></p>

<p><code>$ dpkg-reconfigure tzdata</code></p>

<p><code>$ apt-get install locales</code></p>

<p><code>$ dpkg-reconfigure locales</code></p>

<p><code>$ apt-get install console-data</code></p>

<p><code>$ dpkg-reconfigure console-data</code></p>

<p><code>$ apt-get install lxde-icon-theme</code></p>

<p><code>$ apt-get install midori</code></p>

<p>As JIRA sends a large amount of files and data over HTTP, this can flood the buffers on a swapless system like the Raspberry and lead it to run out of memory. To avoid this a little kernel tweaking needs to take place. Edit <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> (Hint to Linux noobs: <code>nano /etc/sysctl.conf</code>) and add <code>vm.min_free_kbytes = 8192</code> as the last line. Reboot the Raspberry (<code>reboot</code>) and then you are ready to start the GUI with <code>startx</code> and open the Midori web browser from the Desktop menu and open JIRA with the Wallboard plugin running.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>My wallboard configuration in JIRA had 2 dashboards setup as a slideshow with slide left animation. My dashboards contained the following Gadgets</p>

<ul>
<li>Greenhooper Agile Gadget (Used as a Sprint Burndown graph)</li>
<li>Greenhooper Rapid Board (Displays our Current sprint task in swimlanes)</li>
<li>Activity stream</li>
<li>Several JQL Filter Results</li>
</ul>


<p>There is a initial wait of 30 seconds to load the wallboard slide show and the slide animation between dashboards was a little jerky. But this is be to expected on a low power device without much optimization in the compilation of the web browser and javascript engine. Both these performance issues represent no usability problems as a information radiator due to the fact its not an interactive system. These issue are likely to be reduced with optimisation of the software packages (The current focus is to get them to run) and most importantly improvements in the use of Raspberry's dedicated GPU.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>I have tested some TV's with the Raspberry PI and the Raspian distribution and some of them have had issues with the xserver. I haven't had enough time to investigate these issues in detail but a manual configuration of the xserver should be the solution.</p>
